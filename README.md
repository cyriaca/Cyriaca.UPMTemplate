# UPM Package Template

This is a template for a basic Unity UPM package. It requires [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell#get-powershell) for configuration.

1. Copy the contents of this folder (minus `.git/`) to an empty folder.
2. Run `pwsh setup.ps1` and fill out the necessary properties
3. Delete setup.ps1

### Notes

The template includes an MIT license file that should be replaced or removed if an MIT license is not desired.
